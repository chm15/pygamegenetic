# pygamegenetic
The goal of this project was to learn about genetic algorithms. It uses pygame to show what is being simulated. An agent behaves based on measurements taken from the environment, and then is ranked based on how well it performed the task. The top three agents are used to model the next set.

*This repository contains multiple games. It is very old code, I would do it completely different today.
