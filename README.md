# pygamegenetic
This was a project of mine for learning about genetic algorithms. It uses pygame to show what is being simulated. A ball is released, and the ANN is rewarded for the furthest toss. The top three tosses are used to create the next batch of agents, which have slight random modifications from the previous best three.
