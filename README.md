# pygamegenetic
This was a project of mine for learning about genetic algorithms. It uses pygame to show what is being simulated. An agent releases a ball and is rewarded based on how far it threw the ball. The top three tosses are used to create the next batch of agents, which have slight random modifications from the previous best three.
